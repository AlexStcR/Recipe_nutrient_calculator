## Project Overview
This project simplifies nutrition tracking by allowing users to input ingredients and quantities, then calculates total calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat. It uses a cleaned USDA food dataset to ensure accuracy and leverages fuzzy string matching to handle typos or variations in food names (e.g., "tomatos" vs. "tomato").

---

## Features
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Matches user inputs to the closest food name in the database with 80% confidence.
- **Dynamic Nutrient Scaling**: Converts nutrient values to user-specified gram amounts.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages invalid inputs and missing matches.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Includes emojis and clear prompts for an engaging experience.

## Dependencies

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 or later)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [rapidfuzz](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/RapidFuzz)
* [emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/)

## File Structure
1. **`project.py`**
   The core script containing three key functions:
   - **`load_message_user()`**: Displays a welcome message with emojis.
   - **`load_food_database()`**:
     - Loads `cleaned_usda_foods.csv` (preprocessed USDA dataset).
     - Standardizes food names to lowercase and fills missing values with `0`.
   - **`nutrition_calculator()`**:
     - Guides users to input ingredients and amounts.
     - Uses `rapidfuzz` to find the closest food match.
     - Calculates and displays total nutrients.

2. **`cleaned_usda_foods.csv`**
   A cleaned USDA dataset containing:
   - `description`: Standardized food names (e.g., "banana").
   - `calories`, `protein`, `carbs`, `fat`: Nutrients per 100g.

## Data preparation

## Step-by-Step Process of Cleaning USDA Food Data for Nutritional Analysis

As a data professional, cleaning messy datasets is a critical step before analysis. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how I cleaned the USDA food database to create a reliable dataset for nutritional insights:

---

### 1. **Loading & Initial Inspection**
**Datasets Involved**:
- `foods.csv` (food metadata)
- `nutrient.csv` (nutrient definitions)
- `food_nutrient.csv` (nutrient amounts per food)
- `food_portion.csv` (serving sizes)

**First Checks**:
- Printed column names and sample rows to understand structure.
- Identified inconsistencies (e.g., mixed data types in `food_nutrient.csv`).

---

### 2. **Cleaning Food Metadata**
- **Standardized Descriptions**:
  - Converted food names to lowercase and trimmed whitespace.
- **Removed Test Entries**:
  - Filtered out rows containing "test" in descriptions.
- **Deduplication**:
  - Dropped duplicates using `fdc_id` (unique food identifier).
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Removed rows with *all* NaN values.
  - Retained partial NaNs (e.g., `food_category_id`) where acceptable.

---

### 3. **Standardizing Serving Sizes**
- **Focused on Grams**:
  - Filtered `food_portion` data to use only gram-based measurements (`measure_unit_id = 1`).
- **Default Serving Size**:
  - Assigned **100g** as the default for foods lacking portion data.

---

### 4. **Identifying Key Nutrients**
- **Target Nutrients**: Energy (calories), protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
- **Mapped Nutrient IDs**:
  - Used exact names from `nutrient.csv` (e.g., `Energy`, `Total lipid (fat)`).

---

### 5. **Merging & Reshaping Data**
- **Linked Nutrients to Foods**:
  - Joined `food_nutrient` with `nutrient` to attach nutrient names to IDs.
- **Pivoted to Wide Format**:
  - Transformed data into one row per food (`fdc_id`) with nutrient columns.

---

### 6. **Final Adjustments**
- **Calculated per 100g Values**:
  - Formula: `(nutrient value) * (100 / serving size)`.
- **Renamed Columns**:
  - Simplified headers (e.g., `Energy` ‚Üí `calories`).
- **Addressed Duplicates**:
  - Retained unique entries using `fdc_id` even if names overlapped (e.g., "banana").

---

### 7. **Output**
- Saved cleaned dataset as **`cleaned_usda_foods.csv`** with columns:
  - `description`, `calories`, `protein`, `carbs`, `fat`.

---

## Design Choices
1. **Fuzzy Matching with `rapidfuzz`**
   - **Why?** Users often mistype food names (e.g., "brocolli" vs. "broccoli").
   - **Implementation**: `extractOne` with `WRatio` scorer ensures flexible matching while filtering low-confidence matches (`score_cutoff=80`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Lowercase Conversion**: Ensures case-insensitive matching (e.g., "Apple" vs. "apple").
   - **NaN Handling**: Missing values replaced with `0` to avoid calculation errors.

3. **Nutrient Scaling**
   - **Formula**: `(nutrient_per_100g / 100) * user_grams` allows dynamic adjustments.
   - **Default Serving Size**: 100g simplifies calculations if no portion data exists.

4. **User Experience**
   - **Emojis**: Added visual cues (‚úÖ, ‚ùå) to make the CLI more engaging.
   - **Input Validation**: Prevents crashes from non-numeric inputs.

## Data Source

The nutritional data is sourced from the "cleaned_usda_foods.csv" file. It is important to ensure this file is present in the same directory as the Python script. The data in this file is derived from the USDA FoodData Central database.

## Notes

* The accuracy of the calculations depends on the accuracy and completeness of the "cleaned_usda_foods.csv" file.
* The program uses fuzzy matching, so it can handle minor spelling errors, but it may not always find the correct match. It's always a good idea to double-check the matched food item.
* Consider adding more error handling.
* The program assumes that the nutritional values in the database are per 100 grams of food.

---

## How to Use



1.  **Run the script from the command line:**

    ```bash
    python project.py
    ```

2.  **Follow the prompts:**

    * Enter food items when asked.  The program will try to find the closest match in its database.
    * Enter the amount of each food item in grams.
    * Type "done" when you've entered all the ingredients.



## Example

```
Enter food item (or 'done'): apple
‚úÖ Matched: apple, raw (confidence: 100.0%)
Enter grams for apple, raw: 150
Enter food item (or 'done'): chicken breast
‚úÖ Matched: chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, raw (confidence: 95.9%)
Enter grams for chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, raw: 200
Enter food item (or 'done'): done
